2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net U2/U1/BLUE[3]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U2/U1/Blue_reg[3]_i_2/O, cell U2/U1/Blue_reg[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net U2/U1/RED[3]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U2/U1/Red_reg[3]_i_2/O, cell U2/U1/Red_reg[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net U4/U0/seven_seg_reg[0]_P is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U4/U0/seven_seg_reg[0]_LDC_i_1/O, cell U4/U0/seven_seg_reg[0]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net U4/U0/seven_seg_reg[1]_P_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U4/U0/seven_seg_reg[1]_LDC_i_1/O, cell U4/U0/seven_seg_reg[1]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net U4/U0/seven_seg_reg[2]_P is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U4/U0/seven_seg_reg[2]_LDC_i_1/O, cell U4/U0/seven_seg_reg[2]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check

This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#7 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net U4/U0/seven_seg_reg[4]_P is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U4/U0/seven_seg_reg[4]_LDC_i_1/O, cell U4/U0/seven_seg_reg[4]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#8 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net U4/U0/seven_seg_reg[5]_P is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U4/U0/seven_seg_reg[5]_LDC_i_1/O, cell U4/U0/seven_seg_reg[5]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#9 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net U4/U0/seven_seg_reg[6]_P is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U4/U0/seven_seg_reg[6]_LDC_i_1/O, cell U4/U0/seven_seg_reg[6]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
